## Overview

### Who this is for

This guide is for BCIT CST students preparing for, or in, their first co-op term. 

### Who am I

I am a BCIT CST alum (class of 2020) and currently working as a senior software engineer at Rivian. In the distant past, I was a high school teacher in a private school and taught physics, science and design. I've gone through the same process and worked in both a medium-sized company (Visier), and a fintech start-up (formerly known as Grow, now acquired by ATB) for my co-ops. During my professional career, I've mentored peers, reviewed co-op resumes, and mentored a few interns.

### Final note

It is highly possible that the notes here are outdated, or perhaps even incorrect. I encourage everyone reading this to collect as many data points as possible before making any key decisions regarding your career. 

## Co-op Application Timeline

The co-op application process can at times be disheartening, sprinkled with moments of false hope, and even culminate in a disappointing outcome. Regardless of the outcome, I believe there is always something to learn from the experience. Every failure is an opportunity to grow. I've failed countless interviews and every time it's been an invaluable and humbling experience. Honest and critical feedback is rare - and interviews are a great way to get them.

There is so much to talk about the process itself and one could write a New York Times Bestseller about the topic. I have no such ambitions so I've broken down the process into milestones so it is more digestable.

### Applying for co-op

There are two camps when it comes to applying for co-ops. In one camp, folks would spread their net wide and apply to many companies. These people would have a very general criteria for their co-op and essentially want to play a numbers game to land their first co-op. The other camp would narrow their focus and only apply to a select few co-ops. Afterall, one should be tactful with their first co-op since it is a key stepping stone in their career. Both are valid and correct approaches. The only wrong approach is not giving any effort.

Nevertheless, there are some universal truths and questions when it comes to your co-op application. Here are some questions I've heard repeatedly over the years.

**Q: Why would a company hire a co-op? What value do I bring?**

A: Some companies hire co-ops to complete certain tasks, some companies hire co-ops to get funding, some companies are sincere in hiring co-ops to nurture them into potential full-time employees. Unfortunately, at the time being you do not have a lot of ownership over which company decides to hire you. However, it is prudent to understand your role as soon as possible, so you can set realistic expectations for yourself and your team in what you set out to achieve in your co-op.

**Q: Does my first company matter? Should I go for a QA role?**

A: Kind of. There are no absolutes and each person will have a different career journey. Some go on to have very successful careers despite not landing a co-op. Some may land a QA role begrudgingly, only for that opportunity to turn into something else entirely. Some may land a rockstar company for their first co-op, but then struggle to land their first real job. 

Typically, a person pursuing a career as a fullstack web developer would start their career as a QA (co-op), front-end, and then fullstack for their co-ops. From there, they could then apply to QA, fullstack or front-end roles for their first job. I recommend trying every career option during your co-op(s) so you can decide for yourself what career path works best.

**Q: Should I write a cover letter? What's the best way to format my resume?**

A: A person would have completed reviewing your resume by the time you finish reading this sentence. Your resume should be able to highlight your strengths in 5-10 seconds. Highlight any projects and provide links to the repository. Note any achievements, such as hackathon awards, with any links. Unfortunately, your cover letter most likely won't matter. 

Simplify your resume - use a template unless you are absolutely confident in your presonalized resume. I went from hearing back from 1-2 companies per 20 resumes, to 5-6 per 20 just by using Microsoft Word's standard resume template.

**Q: How can I stand out from all the other candidates, especially students from more "reputable" institutions like UBC and SFU?**

A: The hard truth is that some companies will prefer to look for candidates from UBC and SFU even though they accept BCIT students. There is nothing you can do about that. 

Having said that, hackathons and links to well-maintained personal projects always catch my eye when I review resumes. Participating in hackathons demonstrate a willingness to learn and to collaborate with people in seeing a project from conception to delivery, which is an essential skill as a professional software developer. A well-maintained personal project shows an understanding of the deployment lifecycle and the persistence to push something out to production. These give me a better idea of your potential as a software developer than your coursework or grades.

### Before the Interview

Congratulations! You've landed your interview! This is a significant milestone - from here onwards, everything is now within your control. 

For most co-ops, the entire interview process will be split into three parts:
- recruiter screening
- technical interview
- behavioural interview

Each of these interviews require different preparation. I have deep dive [here](./interview/README.md) for each part with examples.

For starters, here are some tips to go by:

* **Learn. Your. Data Structures.** Any solution to an interview question will require some sort of data structure. I won't go into details since there are books written by more qualified people on this topic. 

* **Practice whiteboarding with friends** Solving problems out loud and in front of people is a skill - and to become good at any skill requires practice. The problems don't even have to be technical or software-related.

* **(S)ituation (T)ask (A)ction (R)esult** Find at least three projects where you've made a significant contribution and apply the STAR to it. 

* **Slow down** It's easy to get caught up in the moment and find yourself tongue-tied. That's normal and any reasonable interviewer would undertand your nervousness - heck, they might be nervous too! Forcing yourself to slow down will relax your breathing and help you remain clear-headed.

### During the Interview

This is the big day you've been waiting for. But don't get your hopes too high yet... it's likely you will fail your first interview. Every interview is an opportunity to learn more about the company, the interview process, and also your preparedness. There is nothing to lose - even if you were to fail this one, eventually you will land your second interview.

Lastly, remember to stay hydrated and get a good night's rest before the big day!
