# The Interview

A typical co-op interview

## Recruiter Screening

This should be straightforward "get to know you" meeting with the recruiter. This is done on the company's part to identify any early red flags and to gauge the general fit. I once applied to an engineering position only to find that it was an IT position during this stage of the interview. We both mutually agreed not to proceed with the interview and this saved a lot of people's time.

Some questions you can expect:
* Tell me about yourself
* Why did you apply here?
* What are your long-term and short-terms goals for co-op?

## Technical Interview



## Behavioural Interview

* Describe an instance of where you disagreed with your team
* Give me an example of a project you saw end-to-end and what were some challenging parts?
* Give me a scenario where you made a mistake. What happened and how did you deal with it?
